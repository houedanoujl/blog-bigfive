# Djamo: Goodbye Rejection Fees, Hello Easy Transfers and Discreet Balance! üéâüíÉüèæ

Djamo is an Ivorian FinTech revolutionizing banking services in West Africa (yes, it's possible, there aren't just scammers here). This company has just unveiled a major update to its application, bringing significant improvements that, in my opinion, transform the user experience.

Here are the ones that caught my attention.

## **Goodbye to rejection fees!**

The first big news, and not the least, is the **elimination of rejection fees**. Until now, when a transaction was refused due to insufficient funds, users had to pay an additional 200 FCFA fee. This may seem trivial, but some providers try to charge multiple times in case of an unsuccessful payment attempt, which can significantly reduce your card balance when loading.

With this update, these fees are now a thing of the past. This is good news.

**It's important to note that this elimination of rejection fees should not be seen as a free pass for irresponsible card use**. I encourage you to use your account carefully and thoughtfully and especially to plan your expenses: the idea here is, in my opinion, to simplify life for users.

## **Simplified Orange Money transfers**

The second improvement concerns money transfers via Orange Money. Where previously you had to go through a tedious procedure (either by generating payment codes, through the app or via USSD codes), the process is considerably simplified.

Users can now make transfers directly from one application to another, without having to juggle between different syntaxes: the transfer is done in two screens, the Djamo one where you specify the amount to transfer, and the Orange Money mobile app one where you validate the transaction.

This deeper integration promises to make money transfers faster, simpler, and less prone to errors.

## **Hide your balance**

One of the secrets to achieving happiness and longevity in Africa was given to me about ten years ago by a mentor, in these terms:

_"Little brother... **We don't play with money secrets.** Never let anyone outside your close parents ‚Äî thus excluding your collaborators, your friends, and the rest of the world ‚Äì know how much you earn or what your means are."_

This wisdom underlines the importance of financial discretion, an aspect that Djamo seems to have well understood by introducing the option to hide one's balance.

More seriously, these innovations show that Djamo really understands the needs of its users, from small daily hassles to big financial challenges. I sincerely hope that other players in the sector will be inspired by this dynamic to simplify our lives.
