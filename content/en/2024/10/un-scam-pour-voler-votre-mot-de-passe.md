# A scam imitating Facebook to steal your password

You've probably already received a strange message on WhatsApp, containing links and a call for immediate action, threatening to close your Facebook account if you don't react quickly.

These messages don't come from Facebook: if you click on the links and enter your login credentials, you risk having your account stolen.

In this article, I'll explain how to recognize the scam.

## What is phishing?

Phishing is a method used by scammers who send you messages that look like official notifications, such as those from Facebook, to trick you.

For example, the link is not an official Facebook site. This link leads you to share sensitive information, such as your password or a code, which, once in the hands of scammers, allows them to steal your account.

Here's how the scam works:

1. You receive a WhatsApp message informing you that your Facebook account will be blocked for violating community standards.
2. You're provided with a link to verify your information. Not knowing it's a scam, you click and enter your credentials.
3. Then, you receive a code by SMS to enter on the fraudulent site.
4. Fortunately, Facebook can send you an alert warning you that a suspicious login attempt has occurred. You manage to change your password just in time.

_I must admit that even if Facebook may not be my favorite site, their security system is quite effective._

## What to do if you receive this kind of message?

1. **Don't click on the link!** Even if it seems urgent or official, it's a scam.
2. **Never give your password or a login code.** Facebook will never ask for this information via WhatsApp.
3. **Immediately change your password** if you have clicked or shared your information.
4. **Block and report the number** that sent you the message. On WhatsApp, you can report these messages to prevent other people from falling into the trap.
