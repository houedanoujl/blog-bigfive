# The Art of Indifference and Donuts

After years of navigating the internet, I’ve had plenty of experiences, both positive and negative. Among my less glorious memories is a special folder I once had called "forum weaponry," a virtual arsenal filled with Nostalgia Critic videos ([the eSults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmeou8BM7vU&list=PL0AQIMR-tpokOX4kIXDp4oyq-oqJhjjES&index=12)), sharp comebacks, and biting memes, all designed to put daring souls who provoked me in their place.

I was methodical and ruthless, taking a somewhat wicked pleasure in pushing them to their breaking point until they lashed out with personal insults, often aimed at my family. Then one morning, while rereading my comments in a heated discussion about the _Black Panther_ trailer, I realized I had become what I despised.

I had turned into a troll myself.

This revelation made me rethink the time I wasted in these sterile exchanges. I decided it was time for a new approach—to respond to provocations with humor. Because as you grow older, with more responsibilities, you have less time for trolls.

To illustrate this change, imagine the following scene:

After a long day of work by the Ébrié Lagoon, you head to your favorite restaurant in Biétry. You order four golden donuts, stuffed with minced meat and onions—a true ode to indulgence after a long day. As you’re about to enjoy these delights, three people suddenly appear:

- A man points at your plate: “Have you thought about it? There are families who can’t afford food, and here you are devouring those donuts!”
- A feminist scolds you: “And on top of that, it’s patriarchal to stuff yourself like this! #menareevil”
- A vegan protests: “How dare you consume meat?!”

Faced with this group of moral crusaders, you have three options:

1. **Take your donuts and leave**, letting them carry on with their moral monologue.
2. **Look them calmly in the eyes** and throw out a sharp “Mind your own onions,” trying to ignore their provocations.
3. **Engage in a passionate discussion** about the nutritional benefits of donuts, joyfully debating meat consumption and even patriarchy.

If you choose option three, you’re probably too used to online debates and endless verbal sparring. While your donuts grow cold, you’ll find yourself in the heart of a pointless melee of arguments and nonsensical insults—which will no doubt end in what I call “Biamali,” a local variant of the verb _biama_, meaning “insult fest.”

Option two might seem reasonable but also risks pulling you into a needless dispute.

So that leaves option one: the wisest. Take your donuts with a smile and let them talk into the wind. Ignoring provocations can be truly liberating, and with a bit of practice, it can even become a fun game.

Imagine if, instead of responding to their criticisms with anger, you smiled and said, “You’re all right! I should probably share these donuts. Who wants one first?” Then let them argue among themselves. In the blink of an eye, the conversation shifts into a contest to see who has the best argument, while you peacefully enjoy your donut.

### Conclusion

The next time you come across trolls online or in real life, remember this scene. Preserve your inner peace, avoid unnecessary arguments, and above all, keep smiling… while savoring your moment.
