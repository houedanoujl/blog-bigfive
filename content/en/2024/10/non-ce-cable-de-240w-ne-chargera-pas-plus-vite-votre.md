# No, This 240W Cable Won’t Charge Your Old MacBook Faster

There are three professions whose many members won’t make it to heaven: mechanics, carpenters, and electronics salespeople (with, by extension, their TikTok counterparts). The first because of their tendency to overcharge for repairs, the second due to their notorious inability to keep appointments and deadlines, and the last because many of them don’t know much but fill their intellectual gaps with arrogance or misinformation.

Take this salesperson I met today, for example – in a big store downtown – while I was looking for a cable to charge my (not so old, really) MacBook Pro 2017.

"Hello sir, can I help you?"

"Hello, I’m looking for a cable for my MacBook Pro 2017. USB-C, please."

Ten seconds later, the salesperson presents me with a 240W USB-C cable.

“No, 60W is enough for my MacBook Pro 2017.”

"Ahh, my friend! You need to take the 240W cable. That’s the good one dêh!" he insists, waving a cable in front of my face.

I take a deep breath, trying to stay calm despite my growing impatience.

"Listen, I know what I need. The 240W is excessive for my model."

“No, no! This is the best cable, oh! It’ll charge your laptop at lightning speed!” he persists, with a commercial smile on his face.

“I assure you, it won’t,” I reply firmly. “My MacBook Pro 2017 uses a maximum 87W charger. The 240W cable won’t charge it faster. In fact, a simple 60W cable would be more than enough.”

The salesperson frowns, clearly annoyed to see his sale slipping away. I shake my head, ready to drop some knowledge to end this never-ending conversation: “My MacBook isn’t designed to support a 240W charge. It uses a less powerful charging standard. The charging speed is limited by the internal controller of the laptop, not the cable. Plus, the MacBook automatically negotiates the optimal power with the charger.”

The salesperson looks at me, mouth agape.

I continue: “To get the fastest possible charge, I just need a charger with the same power as the original. A more powerful cable won’t bring any advantage.”

Dismayed, the salesperson tries one last attempt: “But... but usually, well…this is what we sell, ohh.”

“Not in this case,” I respond, finally spotting the 60W cable I need. “This one will do the job just fine. Thank you for your help, but I’ll take this one.”

I grab the 60W cable, leaving the perplexed salesperson behind, and head to the checkout, satisfied to have avoided a pushy sale and eager to finally leave with the right product.

More seriously… your 2017 MacBook Pro isn’t some speed demon designed to absorb 240W like a light breakfast. It prefers a more modest diet, with a less powerful charging standard. Yes, the 240W cable is backward compatible, like an adult who knows how to talk to kids. But it won’t force your MacBook to take in more than it can handle.

In the end, remember that in the world of technology, just like in life, it’s not always the biggest or most powerful that wins. It’s the one best suited to your needs. And that’s something no arrogant salesperson can sell you – you have to know it yourself.
