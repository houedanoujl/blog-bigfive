# We Finished Cleaning Up

I just finished setting up my brand new blog, and I must say... it’s a bit of a revolution! A big thank you to Matt Mullenweg, who unknowingly gave me the nudge I needed to embark on this adventure.

But seriously, I decided to leave WordPress behind and dive into the world of Nuxt 3. You might be wondering why? Well, here are a few reasons that convinced me that Nuxt 3 is the stack I needed.

- Nuxt generates the site quickly;
- There’s no database or plugins to manage;
- Comments are handled via Disqus;
- Fixes are easy to apply and deploy through Git;
- But above all, writing my articles in Markdown is just fantastic. No more struggling with Gutenberg (even though I like it...) or the WordPress editor. Simplicity and efficiency are at the forefront!

Feel free to use this for your blog!
