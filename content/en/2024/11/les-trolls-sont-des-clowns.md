# stoicism and donuts: mastering the art of indifference

With years of online experience, I’ve seen it all—the good moments and the bad. One of my most vivid memories is a folder I once kept called “forum weaponry”—my personal arsenal of sharp memes and Nostalgia Critic comeback videos ([like the eSults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmeou8BM7vU&list=PL0AQIMR-tpokOX4kIXDp4oyq-oqJhjjES&index=12)). All this was for standing up to trolls who dared to challenge me. I was methodical, taking pleasure in pushing them to the brink until their responses turned to personal insults.

Then one day, while rereading my comments in a heated debate over _Black Panther_, I had a revelation: I had become what I despised. I was now part of the noise I once criticized.

This realization made me reconsider how I was spending my time. I decided to change my approach, to respond to provocations with humor, and to practice disengaging. As we grow older, our responsibilities increase, our time decreases, and I realized I had better things to do than waste my energy on trolls.

## The Donut Dilemma

To illustrate this philosophy, imagine the following scene:

After a long day by the Ébrié Lagoon, you head to your favorite restaurant in Biétry. You order four golden donuts stuffed with minced meat and onions—a simple pleasure after a full day. Just as you’re about to enjoy them, three “donut critics” suddenly appear:

- **First Critic**: “How can you eat that when some families can’t even afford food?”
- **Second Critic**: “On top of that, it’s patriarchal to indulge like this! #menaretheproblem”
- **Third Critic**: “And meat, really? How could you!”

Now you have three options:

1. **Take your donuts, hop in your car, and leave**, letting them ramble on.
2. **Look them calmly in the eyes** and, with a smile, say, “Mind your own onions. Mine are fried, paired with juicy meat, and ready to be enjoyed,” ignoring their provocations.
3. **Dive into a heated discussion** on the nutritional benefits of donuts, joyfully debating meat, ethics, and even patriarchy.

Choosing the third option is like diving into what’s called a “Biamali” (a local term meaning “insult fest”). Your donuts will go cold while you’re trapped in a spiral of pointless arguments that inevitably ends with name-calling. The second option, while tempting, could still escalate things. So, what’s left?

The answer is simple: **Option One**—grab your donuts, smile, and let them talk into the void. Ignoring provocations can be incredibly liberating. And with a bit of humor, it even becomes fun.

Imagine smiling and saying, “You’re all absolutely right! In fact, I should probably share. Who wants the first piece?” and watching them get tangled in their own debates while you enjoy your meal.

It’s the same stoic path to follow in the face of online provocations. This approach isn’t apathy; it’s a thoughtful choice. Stoicism teaches us that not every remark or opinion deserves our attention. Think of your priorities as “your donuts.” You wouldn’t let someone grab your donuts without saying anything; so why let them steal your peace or joy?

When you feel the urge to respond to an online critique or unsolicited opinion, ask yourself: is this a battle worth fighting, or would my energy be better spent elsewhere? Setting a polite but firm boundary by saying “mind your own business” protects your peace without fanning the flames.

Next time you encounter trolls—online or in real life—think of this story. Embrace the art of indifference. Protect your donuts, protect your peace, and remember that not every critic deserves a reaction. Let them fade as you savor what matters most.
