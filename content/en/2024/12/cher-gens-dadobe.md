# Coca-Cola, AI and Christmas: a mix that gets people talking (and selling too)

Just like KFC on December 24th in Japan or pistachio sauce on New Year's Day on the shores of the Ébrié Lagoon, Coca-Cola's magical advertisements during the holiday season are an unmissable tradition.
This year, the brand decided to add a technological touch to its Christmas magic.
[![Coca-Cola Holidays Are Coming](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8m0Y-GisSeM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m0Y-GisSeM)

For its "Holidays Are Coming" campaign, Coca-Cola offered the public its first major experience with an artificial intelligence-generated video advertisement(1).
The public didn't embrace it, finding the overall aesthetic of the video
disconcerting, even imperfect for a company of Coca-Cola's stature. Social networks ignited, debates heated up, and dialogue was created... probably all around cans and bottles of Coca-Cola.

In clearer terms, this (well-orchestrated) marketing strategy worked. Thanks to this video, Coca-Cola managed to occupy the field and embed itself in minds: whether you like it or not, you're talking about Coca-Cola.
This is more than enough to strengthen its association with Christmas, pitting those who prefer the old commercials (I'm one of them) against those who appreciate novelty and are passionate about technology.

The goal wasn't to convince or please everyone.
No, the stakes are elsewhere: to make an impression and anchor the brand even more deeply in the collective holiday imagination.

The brand has succeeded in occupying the field and strengthening its association with Christmas. That's what matters, isn't it?

## \*(1)From a technical standpoint, this advertisement is generated by a DALL-E-based model, thus obsolete at a time when [Google Video 2](https://www.instagram.com/generativeai_official/reel/DDwb4ZmSl7C/) has impressed us all with its photorealism and ability to maintain consistency from scene to scene, as well as respect physics.
