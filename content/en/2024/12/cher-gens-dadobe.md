# Why So Much Hatred Towards Adobe? Because It's Deserved.

Although Affinity Designer is an excellent alternative, in a professional context, I have no choice but to use Adobe. Indeed, most of the designs I need to transform into code and websites are created in Adobe, and I have not yet mastered Affinity Photo 2 sufficiently to confidently edit RAW files from my Theta Z1 camera.

I must therefore use Adobe... but sometimes at the expense of my mental health, not to mention the cost. I concede that my judgment might be slightly exaggerated, but I am profoundly disappointed by the lack of alternatives to Adobe.

However, this morning, my frustration reached a breaking point. I HATE Adobe, and I have sworn to fully immerse myself in the Affinity suite, far from Adobe's troubles. Allow me to explain.

Everything began on a Friday the 13th, when I wanted to update my payment methods on an Adobe account. The first surprise of a series that would make this morning particularly challenging:

- It is impossible to do this independently, as the menu command typically found elsewhere does not exist. One must mandatorily go through their customer service, which is anything but quick and simple.
- After clicking the "help" button, you will be confronted with an artificial intelligence that seems designed either to test your patience or to make you abandon your quest.

Unfortunately for them, I am the patient and determined type when dealing with certain companies (including, but not limited to, my bank, Apple, and Adobe).

## Survival Guide: How to Escape Adobe's AI

1. **Demand a Human**: Insist, repeat "I want to speak to a human" until the AI yields (while remaining polite).
2. **Choose an Option, Any Option**: No need to be precise; the important thing is to progress.
3. **Persist**: Continue until a human agent finally intervenes.

After considerable effort, I managed to speak with a consultant. Reluctantly, he acceded to my request. Everything seemed finally settled until, 30 minutes later, I discovered an Adobe Express subscription added to my account.

I do not even use this service and do not wish to pay more than necessary. Moreover, Canva is far superior in the realm of all-in-one, user-friendly editors.

A new battle with customer service ensued: "I do not want Adobe Express, I do not use it, and I do not want to pay for it." After dealing with two customer service representatives, I canceled this unsolicited subscription. However, this experience left a bitter taste: Adobe, through its abusive practices, provokes largely merited criticism and the hatred of the world. On the internet, in life, and in public forums.

Indeed, Adobe is facing several lawsuits for questionable commercial practices:

- **Hidden Cancellation Fees**: The U.S. Department of Justice is pursuing Adobe for concealing cancellation fees that can reach several hundred dollars. These fees concern annual subscriptions paid monthly.
- **Misleading Interfaces**: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accuses Adobe of designing interfaces that push users to subscribe without clearly disclosing conditions. Cancellation then becomes an obstacle-laden journey.

These stories reveal a well-established strategy to deliberately frustrate the user experience.

## Conclusion: How to Confront Adobe?

Stop using their services, if possible. Or opt for a monthly subscription, without commitment.
