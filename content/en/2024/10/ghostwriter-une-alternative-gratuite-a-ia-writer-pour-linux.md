# Ghostwriter, the iA Writer of Linux

Changing my blog engine allowed me to:

1. (Re)discover the Markdown language
2. Dust off my distraction-free writing environments, like OmmWriter or iA Writer

## iA Writer: the best Markdown editor?

In my opinion, iA Writer is the best Markdown editor in the world. Here's why:

- Its user interface is free from unnecessary distractions, with a distinctive blue insertion point.
- It offers a 'focus' mode that highlights the current line, sentence, or paragraph being written, dimming the rest of the text.
- iA Writer is designed to keep the user's attention centered on the text, not on the user interface or formatting.

However, iA Writer is only compatible with Windows and macOS operating systems at the time of writing.

## Searching for an alternative for Linux

My main computer is an HP Pro x2 hybrid tablet running Linux (specifically the latest version of Zorin OS Pro). While looking for an alternative to iA Writer, I discovered [Ghostwriter](https://ghostwriter.kde.org/ "Ghostwriter").

## Ghostwriter: a serious competitor

This free application incorporates my favorite features from iA Writer:

- The famous blue insertion point
- A focus mode similar to iA Writer's
- Integrated spell checking

To make spell checking work in French, you need to install hunspell-fr with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install hunspell-fr
```

## Conclusion

Although iA Writer remains a reference in the field of Markdown editors, Ghostwriter proves to be an excellent alternative for Linux users. It offers a distraction-free writing experience similar to iA Writer, while being free and open-source. For writers, bloggers, or any user looking for a clean and efficient writing environment on Linux, Ghostwriter is certainly worth trying.
